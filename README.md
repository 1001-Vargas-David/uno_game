## Project: Uno


## Project explanation

This project simulates the Uno card game with the basic rules of the game and with some rules proposed by me **(Luis Miguel Rosario)**.
I hope you like it and you can learn more about this famous card game developed with the purpose of putting my knowledge into practice in the programming area.

## How does the project work?

When executing the code in the main file, the program will ask you to enter the number of players and the names of each one (the number of players must be between 2 to 10).
Then  the rules will be displayed and you must press a key to start, At the start of the game each player receives 7 cards and the player who registered first begins.
The names of the players and their points will be shown in the terminal also the player's hand to play. A menu of options will be displayed:

* r: Steal a card.
* w: You say "Uno"(only to be used when playing your penultimate card).
* q: Play a card(you must ensure that there is a card in your hand that matches the card on the table, if you meet this condition your hand will have an enumeration from 0 to  the length of your hand and for play you must choose the correct number at is the position of the card).

## Used technology

This project was developed using the code editor visual studio code with the python language with which I practice the object-oriented paradigm. Besides used git as version control and  github as remote repository for my project.
